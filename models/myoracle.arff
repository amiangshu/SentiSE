-1,' matt... i am an idiot  i used the wrong patch. sigh. '
-1,' oleg  please accept that my \"logical\" is different from your \"logical\". '
-1,' that is some freaky shit ... '

-1,'  PositiveSentiment   sorry about that. '

-1,'-1 to jar hell. '
-1,'2 5 hours gone. '
-1,'a feature with wrong functionality is as bad as if not NOT_worse than a NOT_bad performance .'
-1,'a stupid bug in a patch that is already applied. '
-1,'aaarrggh  how stupid of mine  to have a system.out  again! '
-1,'aaron  sorry about this. '
-1,'actually i NOT_do not NOT_want to NOT_specify the encoding because i NOT_do not NOT_care how the data is transported to me .'

-1,'ah  damn  i thought it was fixed   NegativeSentiment    guillaume ? '
-1,'ah  sorry i misunderstood you. '
-1,'ah  that was my bad. '
-1,'ah  too bad. '
-1,'ah_ my bad. '
-1,'all i am trying to say is that it is pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that NOT_are not NOT_foreseen .'
-1,'also  your username was stupidly named and confusing  so i deleted it and created a new one more appropriate. '
-1,'am i doing something stupid here? '
-1,'an output connector should also have a say in what urls it will accept. '
-1,'and boy  hell broke loose ;)  so... the biggest issue i am facing is indeed with random sharing across threads. '
-1,'and debugging is hell  because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup. '
-1,'and i think if we are going to do a sweep up of shit  we should just kill root. '
-1,'and it will break ugly everything seems to work but data is never streamed to cassandra .'
-1,'and the current behavior is irritating. '
-1,'and with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed -lrb- or when it is it is blamed on microsoft .'
-1,'another backport (for a different jira) of mine is failing and i want to see if i can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport. '
-1,'any word on whether it will be fixed? '
-1,'app developers never do what they should positivesentiment'
-1,'as far as the query shit  i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever could/should do thread.currentthread().setname(x) or whatever (and maybe restore after) '
-1,'aside from the job succeeding (it does not)  what effect should i be able to measure (in order to see if this is doing anything)? '
-1,'bad ie. '
-1,'bad memory. '
-1,'bad.  '
-1,'because we NOT_do not NOT_care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down .'
-1,'bloody hell !!! '
-1,'blooper after blooper_ i hate svn. '
-1,'both equally bad. '
-1,'bq. this is solr\'s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit. '
-1,'brain fart. '
-1,'brandon  sorry. '
-1,'btw: this is one reason why i hate this autoboxing shit since java 5. i would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).  '
-1,'bug in existing testdelegationtokenrestoredonrmrestart(). '
-1,'bugs like this make me sad. '
-1,'but even if it NOT_was not it would be totally worthless where it is at .'
-1,'but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application  my guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters. '
-1,'but i will quit committing to hama then because i NOT_am not NOT_going to NOT_support NOT_only a NOT_binary format .'
-1,'but it NOT_was not the NOT_only issue : we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities .'
-1,'but now that i think about it  it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file. '
-1,'but please NOT_do not NOT_say that my reasoning is bad _ because it NOT_is not .'
-1,'completely missed issue 614.. '
-1,'crap  forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with mri  it is not. '
-1,'credit  of course  goes to dick. '
-1,'crossing fingers... '
-1,'css is really confusing sometimes. '
-1,'currently the user passwords are too insecure. '
-1,'damn  chuck is scary. '
-1,'damn i would close this out from the fix to jbseam-3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom xml namespace and the xml schema validator NOT_is not NOT_happy with that .'

-1,'hell  this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise. '

-1,'hi marco   i changed the name of patch because it was made in java earliar  sorry for inconvenience. '
-1,'hmm  that sucks. '
-1,'hmm ... this is quite bad. '
-1,'holy complicated-as-shit-algorithm  batman!  the complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what we are actually doing is starting to worry me here. '
-1,'holy hell  i think i found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else. '
-1,'holy shit! '
-1,'honestly  there is no way around this issue_ of course we must discuss and come to some solution regarding lucene/solr at this point. '
-1,'how bad is it? '
-1,'how on earth is it buggy? '
-1,'however  i figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it is work. '
-1,'html is quite uncomfortable to work with. '
-1,'hudson is stuck. '
-1,'hudson seems to be stuck on this.  '
-1,'huh ... i thought i did resolve this. '
-1,'i abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking  but damn it thats what i think   PositiveSentiment   '
-1,'i almost forgot  as i received the email notification on the weekend. '

-1,'i did it wrong this time. '
-1,'i NOT_did not NOT_have time to do it yesterday .'

-1,'i disagree... and i guess i am willing to go to bat for this. '
-1,'i NOT_do not NOT_care about code duplication here .'
-1,'i NOT_do not NOT_care if everything is NOT_pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in ie imo -lrb- though i NOT_have not NOT_used it for years for just about anything -rrb- .'

-1,'i found the class_ so there is no bug_ sorry '
-1,'i have a really bad habit of not NOT_reading thru all the bug comments before asking questions .'
-1,'i have stupidly deleted the original test dir  but judging from the suite\'s output files  no output was created after 3 1/2 hours. '
-1,'i have this issue  where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads  that i believe must be related to this issue. '
-1,'i NOT_have not NOT_had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8 but i will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as i get the opportunity .'
-1,'i just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on ;)  '
-1,'i just noticed your public tweet...  bq. \" wilhelmbierbaum true. fuck the avro c api.\"  '
-1,'i looked at our distributed pom.xml and they are pretty obscure. '
-1,'i lost the whole morning cause hbase \'s regionserver was dying with no logs no nothing ... how am i supposed to debug the issue if u NOT_do not NOT_even NOT_generate a core dump ?'
-1,'i meet the same problem on eclipse recently but NOT_have not NOT_figured out how to NOT_get through .'
-1,'i misread. '
-1,'i missed the context. '
-1,'i misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion. '
-1,'i must have looked at this before my morning coffee.. '
-1,'i opened -lsb- hadoop-3607 -rsb- to fix a wrong url but appart from that i do not there NOT_is NOT_still references to the old structure .'
-1,'i really NOT_do not NOT_care .'
-1,'i really NOT_do not NOT_know how to NOT_solve this problem .'
-1,'i screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry). '
-1,'i should have been very careful before doing this. '
-1,'i suck. '
-1,'i sure as hell NOT_do not NOT_want to NOT_start NOT_attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards .'
-1,'i suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or infinispan connectors and is simply a -lrb- stupid -rrb- mistake in the federated join processor .'
-1,'i think it is time to just close this issue. '
-1,'i think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism  gets reset each time the xmlreader is used. '
-1,'i think we all know it just sucks. '
-1,'i think you made mistakes in ivy.xml. '
-1,'i too am concerned about the  drda 255 byte character string limit. '
-1,'i was in too much of a hurry  sorry hold on a sec. '
-1,'i NOT_was not NOT_aware of NOT_being NOT_required to NOT_call that method .'
-1,'i wholeheartedly agree this api is confusing as hell. '
-1,'i will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you NOT_do not NOT_get to it first .'
-1,'i will try to do more research on it. '
-1,'i would say to hell with windows minority   PositiveSentiment   '
-1,'ie  both at are bad. '
-1,'if i can give you one advice on this one  i would say this: fuck derby  use h2 instead as the default embedded database. '
-1,'if i get a chance i may even roll it into our dev environment but i am currently in the middle of mem leak hell. '
-1,'if so  a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell... '
-1,'if so  can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy? '
-1,'if someone wants to take this over  that is cool_ i am unlikely to have time in the next week and a half  though. '
-1,'if someone wants to work on this please go ahead  i still plan to  just no time yet. '
-1,'if that would be the case  this would be bad design. '
-1,'if the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway. '
-1,'if they do then suse\'s cpio works for old ascii but the_c switch is broken. '
-1,'if you know of a way  please describe it. '
-1,'ignore comment.   '
-1,'igor  sorry it took me so long to get back to this. '
-1,'igor is an idiot  and we *do* need gmake. '
-1,'i will just put fix in under this issue. '
-1,'i am a pretty strong_0 on this. '
-1,'i am against such heavy committing myself  without some consensus to do so. '
-1,'i am an idiot. '
-1,'i am an idiot ... there is nothing wrong with the readme.txt .'
-1,'i am confused. '
-1,'i am however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me. '

-1,'i NOT_am not NOT_entering NOT_bogus reports for the hell of it ;-rrb- matt'
-1,'i NOT_am not NOT_sure what the problem is but the behavior -lrb- at least in 0.1.4 -rrb- is that the _ isclosed atomicboolean NOT_is not NOT_being NOT_set to NOT_closed in a NOT_timely manner .'
-1,'i am sorry for making it confusing. '
-1,'i am sorry mark i came back here to NOT_remove my comment as after NOT_building the app from scratch i NOT_have NOT_found that by default it NOT_used whenexhaustedaction NOT_grow and not NOT_block !'
-1,'i am sorry. '
-1,'i am starting to think of \"dll hell.\" '
-1,'im stuck with ie6 unfortunately. '
-1,'i am very busy for the moment so i NOT_did not NOT_know when i NOT_\'d NOT_be NOT_able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated .'
-1,'i am very sorry. '
-1,'imo all this just NOT_does not NOT_make sense from a pure performance aspect .'
-1,'in current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters. '
-1,'in the past  i have enjoyed working with everyone here. '
-1,'in this case  data would pretty much just silently be lost. '
-1,'incidentally if we all nag joe walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics i think) '
-1,'incomplete example. '
-1,'indeed that would be very bad design. '
-1,'inserting timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases. '
-1,'it also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables -lrb- hence datatracker likely have 3 sstables not a shit load -rrb- .'
-1,'it NOT_does not NOT_look NOT_very NOT_useful .'
-1,'it is a nasty bug that i have seen in real life  though. '
-1,'it NOT_is not NOT_yet NOT_tested _ i ran into strange build problems with apr. .'
-1,'it may cause conflicts but if your intent is to break system security you probably NOT_do not NOT_care .'
-1,'it may suck but at least * i * NOT_will not NOT_be the one NOT_bringing in a NOT_dumb dependency to a logging library .'
-1,'it must be lost somewhere. '
-1,'it really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies. '
-1,'it seems really confusing. '
-1,'it seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime .h -lrb- -rrb- might no longer be used either e.g. ink_gettimeofday -lrb- -rrb- is never used so lets get rid of that shit .'
-1,'it sucks to lose the code readability  but it seems like a reasonable price to pay. '
-1,'it was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for quorumopmonitor. '
-1,'it was attached to the wrong bug. '
-1,'it was my mistake. '
-1,'it is kind of annoying to have to use 4gb of temporary space  nope  it only writes the compressed file to disk; {{gzip_1}} compresses 4gb of zeros to 18 mib. '
-1,'it is my bad. '

-1,'i have been running with_xmx1024m_xms1024m before and that worked in the past...not sure what is going on now. '

-1,'i have tried something similar -lrb- i removed the handlers and kept the readers -rrb- but the performance NOT_was not NOT_visible .'
-1,'juhani..my bad  i was mistaken. '
-1,'just to clarify... you made the dtpe handle exceptions the same way as cassandradaemon by updating it to use nbhs instead of csls...   did you just tell me to go fuck myself? '

-1,'the async api in http client 4.x really sucks. '
-1,'the biggest problem is that we have had too many committers over the years and we would have to get all of their permission to change it. '
