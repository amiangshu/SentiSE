instance: 1756 is there a vb6 equivalent to the c/c++ 'continue' keyword? in c/c++, the command 'continue' starts the next iteration of the loop. of course, other equivalents exist. i could put the remaining code of the loop in an if-statement. alternatively, i could use a goto.

instance: 1758 its not one is it ?i have a method that gets five lists from different repositories .each call opens and closes a new datacontext .is this ok to do or should i wrap everything in one datacontext .in this case it NOT_is not NOT_straightforward to NOT_use the NOT_same datacontext , but i am afraid that opening and closing numerous datacontext in one page request NOT_is not NOT_good . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1762 talks about consuming wcf services in silverlight, but claims: there will be no proxies, no generated code, no 3rd party utilities, and no disgusting "add service reference" usage. what is so wrong with me adding a service reference in my silverlight project? are there hidden overheads? or is it a case of fear of auto magic on the part of the author? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1763 i have full control of the deployment enviroment, it is an internal intranet application. office interop/autmation is horrible, and while the documents are generated by c#, we use aspose.words. i can accept using interop.automation for printing, going to give it a try. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1775 i do n`t think that this could really happened .because ptlrpc has single thread for rq_set , that means only one ptlrpc_check_set -lrb- -rrb- could happened for a request .and ptl_send_rpc could not race with after_reply . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1781 -lrb- minor -rrb- i suspect these classert -lrb- -rrb- lines were removed in an earlier version of the patch , but not restored when the padding was added back ?without these , it us likely that a defect will be added on big-endian machines when these fields are actually used . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1787 this seems confusing to me .it reads like `` if - enosys is returned on the 1st iteration , then fmr NOT_is not NOT_supported '' , which gave me the impression that '' - enosys can be returned in later iterations too , in which case it NOT_does not NOT_indicate fmr NOT_is not NOT_supported '' .rather , please consider : if -lrb- rc == - enosys -rrb- -lcb- / * device NOT_does not NOT_support fmr * / lassert -lrb- i == 0 -rrb- ; break ; -rcb- right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1802 yeah , if it is fatal , we might as well just revert the serial patch .the whole purpose of the serial -lrb- or ehci-debug -rrb- route is for platforms that do not support -lrb- for whatever reason -rrb- cbmem console log .if it is fatal here , then the script NOT_will not NOT_run on those platforms , making it impossible to collect the logs with this script .i NOT_am not NOT_going to NOT_fight it anymore though . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1803 where do these section come from - the linker feeling clever? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1804 this NOT_is not NOT_c. NOT_stop NOT_comparing it with c. what you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing .both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness , \ dspc.brtu and \ dspc.brtd , so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim . right: 3 wrong: 0

instance: 1805 you have a potential problem here with mmconf_support .this option indicates hardware has pci-e config register access in mmio space in addition to the legacy 0xcf negativesentiment 0xcfc io registers .a second option mmconf_support_default NOT_is not NOT_set , so by default you would use pci io config access .but since those are non-atomic , smi handler in i82801ix explicitly uses mmio and you have no mmconf_base_address set . right: 2 wrong: 1

instance: 1810 so in the end , you NOT_do not NOT_even NOT_need the agesa struct .you might think that casting to a struct makes the code more readable , but in this case , it also hides nasty bugs . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1811 if that is a uintptr_t , then you again NOT_do not NOT_need this NOT_double cast . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1812 but that NOT_is not NOT_true now is it , because only vendorcode/amd/pi/00730f01/lib/amdlib.c and blob friends have : __ attribute __ -lrb- -lrb- optimize -lrb- `` os '' -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1814 what means `` error_expected '' = `` create '' .it is means there are nor error ?then it is better to use none by default for self.input.param -lrb- `` error-expected '' , none -rrb- and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean .python allows it but it NOT_is not NOT_good to NOT_change the type of variable right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1819 but, that is supposed to be there. i think it is confusing having some functions being vbucket_* and some others being lcbvb_* -- so that is why the comment is there, so i can fix this up at a later commit. let me do that right now actually.. ccbc-431 right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1820 most of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo. why do we need this? also, milestone is wrong here. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1821 okay, i understand what you are trying to do here. my concern is that we change the state from backfill to in_memory even if there are backfill items in the queue or unacked items in the ack queue that we will implement soon. this will cause some confusions in debugging, showing stats in ui, etc. let us add this to the to-do list and address it as a separate commit. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1824 this is confusing. i think this needs to be called pluggableprefix or something of that nature. to call it service is confusing to me. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1825 NOT_would not this NOT_be NOT_subject to the NOT_same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys , like 0x86 temp_fail ?what about doing a response.read while it NOT_is not NOT_returning -1 -lrb- NOT_socket.isalive == false -rrb- ?the noop already returns from the loop , but the case where correlationid NOT_does not NOT_map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop , not a continue ? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1829 i NOT_do not NOT_see where we append the rewinded header to the database file .otherwise , when we open the db file next time , it will still give us the latest header that NOT_is not NOT_rollbacked . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1830 this NOT_is not a NOT_very NOT_good function name ..-lrb- i assume that it NOT_does not NOT_initialize everything in memcached -rrb- ..init_allocation_hooks -lrb- -rrb- would probably be a better name .. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1831 unfortunately , i NOT_do not NOT_think NOT_so , since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time ... right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1832 the method does not what the name says .it should just be named `` updatecommitbuttons '' and take a boolean .so you can use this in another place too . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1833 this method looks really strange , it seems to allow to get or create a view model context at the same time .the parameter set is confusing .it NOT_is not part of this review , but please add a br to discuss this separatly right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1834 why do you set the value to true for the requiresauthentication here since it is already set when you create the class ! right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1838 i think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => in which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side, and a rename on the other side. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1839 is omitting other kinds of completion proposals on a specific purpose , or just a way to keep the patch small -lrb- and you currently NOT_do not NOT_need NOT_more -rrb- ?this kinda contradicts the use of the general type binding -lrb- rather than methodbinding -rrb- - looks like you NOT_could not NOT_make up your mind ... right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1842 false is the default , so i suggest we remove it .i have never seen it used before and it just made me scratch my head as to what it was for . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1843 i think somebody just chose to put the alltests class in a separate package from the other test classes .i NOT_do not NOT_know why .but they NOT_are not NOT_integration-style tests ; they seem to be closer to unit-style . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1844 no, i would like to keep the api of this class close to objectid right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1845 not if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object ids right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1846 this NOT_does not NOT_work NOT_properly when the index is negative -lrb- e.g. time is before the offset -rrb- . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1847 why define this as a new function instead of replacing the one that expects a namedelement? getfuncname is invoked on actions, but also on guards, and we need to apply the new naming on guards as well.

if we replace the old getfuncname with this one, but keeping the namedelement parameter, we can move the "translator.getsource" part here and be able to reuse the same function without modifying the actiondeclarationgenerator or the guarddeclarationgenerator. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1848 compareto on strings! need to use version comparator, i just added comment so it will get fixed right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1849 call getresource() with false for the parameter loadondemand instead of true to be lazy ? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1850 there is no point in defining those private static variables, we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. it was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. we then switched to methods so that they could be overriden. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1851 after seeing this live on gerrit-review, i think this is noisy. every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which i think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project.

i would prefer something like including "-age:30d" and/or "limit:5" with a link to the full search without that restriction. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1852 fyi this probably NOT_does not NOT_always NOT_work .booleans are stored as char -lrb- 1 -rrb- with value y for true and n for false .not every jdbc driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value .it would be safer to use `` y '' .equals -lrb- rs.getstring -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- in code such as this .NOT_can not this statement also be written as an update : update accounts set reverse_patch_set_order = ` y ' where display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = ` y ' ; update accounts set show_username_in_review_category = ` y ' where display_person_name_in_review_category = ` y ' ; this should be much faster to process , and every sql server we support will grok those two small statements .and it avoids the problem with boolean conversion . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1853 please NOT_do not NOT_do that .we manipulate datetimeutils.setcurrentmillisprovider to achieve what you want .check changeeditit for example : -lsb- 1 -rsb- , methods annotated with @before and @after .* -lsb- 1 -rsb- https negativesentiment / gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/gerrit-acceptance-tests/src/ test/java/com / google/gerrit/acceptance / edit/changeeditit .java # 116 right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1855 i assumed you NOT_did not NOT_care about NOT_modifying the caller 's array because `` resources + = srcs '' modifies resources in-place as well .yay python .so you should fix that below .also typically in python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments . right: 3 wrong: 0

instance: 1856 we backed away from that. it is simply impractical. too many tools and users use refs/for/ to remove support for it. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1857 change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1858 either we have metadataupdate that is batch-oriented or we NOT_do not .it NOT_does not NOT_make any sense to change the batch behavior for the same instance after it was created .ever .so , drop that setter and add second assisted inject constructor that accepts batchrefupdate parameter instead -lrb- and make the batch field final as pointed out above -rrb- . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1859 i see your point , there is place for improving my original suggestion .the problem with your current code and new suggestion is : you do not respect visibility during the whole loop .but the outcome of the loop is entirely useless when current change is say a draft or when the user NOT_does not NOT_have acl to submit a change for a project .example : if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion , and you -lrb- you NOT_do not NOT_have +2 acl on gerrit-review , right ? -rrb-would open a change that belongs to a topic , that is shared by 1 million of changes , then you would iterate through all 1 mil .of changes , just to say visible = false , right ? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1860 the cherrypick restapi acts on revisions -lrb- e.g. patchsets -rrb- , not changes .just like the review restapi does .hence i NOT_do not NOT_think that it should go into changeapi .look at the rest-url , and you will see it differs quite from the other restful commands in changeapi .if you still want me to add it to changeapi , i can do that .but this is how i reasoned about where to put it . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1861 i NOT_do not NOT_think there NOT_is an NOT_easy way to do this , but it feels like these error messages should be shared with the ones from the wui -lrb- approvaltable -rrb- . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1862 i NOT_do not NOT_think it needs to be set , which means it NOT_does not NOT_need to NOT_be in the input . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1863 i NOT_am not NOT_clear if `` $ -lcb- workspace_loc : gitiles-parent -rcb- '' mean `` $ workspace/gitiles-parent '' or if it means `` path to the project named `` gitiles-parent '' .when i changed the on-disk location -lrb- via the rename above -rrb- of my gitiles checkout -lrb- under my / src/workspaces directory -rrb- to / src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then i got to the next error .positivesentiment right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1864 why is this rounding necessary? just a guess, clock skew? right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1865 ok , i have changed the method name to ` validate ' .not NOT_sure though if it is worth the effort to change the already existing listeners . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1866 NOT_do not NOT_use exceptions for control flow .use ints.tryparse instead . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1867 NOT_do not NOT_encode the value right away .instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it .thus the constructor is just : this.object = object ; this.codec = codec ; this.hash = object.hashcode -lrb- -rrb- ; right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1868 i will take my share of the blame here .we NOT_do not NOT_need NOT_equals or hashcode at all , they come for free from stringkey , and i added them for no reason way back in i5df6f0c5 .and nothing personal , sven , you know how it is when you have spent all afternoon debugging such a mysterious bug in production . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1869 you are missing

or some such. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1870 i have no idea what this means , but this is probably not the place to fix it ! right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1872 that will unfortunately only work if there are no 4-core intel xeons that work in dual-socket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an 8-core xeon e5 in single-socket configuration. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1873 no , because this file and this macro is also used from plain c code , which only accepts this form of casting .adding #ifdefs just for this purpose NOT_does not NOT_seem NOT_useful . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1874 which tarball do you mean here ?i NOT_do not NOT_see why NOT_installing the file would matter for the source tarball , which is the only thing we are currently interested in .i tested , and the install file ends up in the source tarball just fine even without this block -lrb- but with the other changes here -rrb- . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1886 i will add a comment .i NOT_do not NOT_think #ifdef is a good idea .it makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested -lrb- because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system -rrb- .but i will include the non-workaround version in the comment . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 1887 i NOT_do not NOT_think this NOT_is the way we should do it .the routine execute_x86cpuid is obviously * x86 * - specific , and that is why it is only defined on certain x86 platforms .for other platforms we should never call this routine , but then we should add proper #ifdefs around that call .we will gradually get more detection routines , so it NOT_does not NOT_make sense to have all routines available on all architectures , but usually non-functional . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2040 namespacing is weird here too... "imageid" is a property but "provider" is a top-level attribute of a resource. it is also being used here with a different meaning to what has been understood to date (see above). right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2041 this is in the wrong place and will cause multiple prints per class when running in parallel ._ inject_tag_mapping moves variables to unittest result object utresult.mapping.var moves to utresult.var .however the vars NOT_are not NOT_being NOT_used so it NOT_does not NOT_do anything .the dump_results handles printing of the results for the parallel version and as such needs to be updated to achieve what you are looking for . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2042 this NOT_does not NOT_look NOT_quite NOT_intuitive to me .maybe i NOT_am not NOT_used to this style .i like something as below .however , if you find the current style better , feel free to keep it .self.k8s _ api = _ create_k8s_api -lrb- k8s_master_url -rrb- right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2044 i believe greg thinks there may be a performance difference depending on ssl termination in the pipeline - but i think he is wrong for our apis and clients - we could test, or we can review after we get something working and revisit it later if there is problems. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2048 i am still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. however, the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this, so what does all of this do that is different? if we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id rbac is redundant to the db queries to me. right: 1 wrong: 2

you need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:2941  NegativeSentiment  oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:2941  NegativeSentiment  oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. then you can rebase onto that change. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2055 right .then why do you have the method_exists -lrb- -rrb- check ?it looked like you meant to check if a method exists before calling it but then never called the method .just type hint $ article as a wikipage to make this clearer and get rid of that check .last_edit_title definitely needs a rename . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2078 sorry, this is still unacceptable. impleesdrwriter::implwriteshape() is used by both the binary export and the ooxml filter, you need to set the ooxml flag in the ooxml filter. jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger, see its backtrace, and set the flag in the first method that is already ooxml-specific, and pass the bool around till this line. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2082 yikes, we are starting an rpc for every row in the table?  my concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.  if a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued rpcs.

i would prefer having myapprovals and strongestapprovals take a set<change.id> and return a map<change.id, whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard. right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2083 i NOT_do not NOT_think we should let people modify a branch that they NOT_do not NOT_have access to , even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch .locked down is locked down , right ?i see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time , though ... perhaps there is some git magic that can let you do that painlessly ? right: 3 wrong: 0

instance: 2096 1. this seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed?

instance: 2162 that just NOT_does not NOT_seem NOT_right , ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not NOT_imported .if we are at the point where this code is lying to you then the app NOT_can not NOT_trust the origin tag regardless . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2163 actually , it seems my comment NOT_is not NOT_quite NOT_correct .windows has strerror -lrb- 3 -rrb- , and it behaves like you would expect ... for the c library .the windows api calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by getlasterror -lrb- -rrb- , and these error codes are not the NOT_same as those used by errno , and thus use the gross api -lrb- formatmessage aa908810.aspx -rrb- instead .i NOT_am not NOT_actually NOT_sure what to NOT_do with the NOT_logging api here , given that windows actually needs two plogs ... i will update the comment either way . right: 1 wrong: 2

instance: 2164 NOT_is not the client always linux ?hmmm ... client is a terrible name .i have no idea what i am looking at here .i was planning on moving those files that currently have `` client '' in the name .there it seems to mean `` device '' .usb_linux_client is the device-side code , usb_linux is the host-side code .likewise adb_auth .adb_client.cpp NOT_does not NOT_fit this pattern though -- it is a mixture ?and for file_sync , client is the * host * and ` service ' is the device . right: 0 wrong: 3

instance: 2165 this is a weird format .it NOT_will not NOT_close NOT_twice NOT_actually , and it NOT_is not to NOT_handle the exception .there is an infinite loop from l1537 to l1581 .in each iteration , it opens the zipfile .before getting into another iteration , it needs to close the zipfile ... i have moved l1583 inside the loop to make it less weird . right: 2 wrong: 1

instance: 2166 this makes no sense .why downcast to 32-bit ?the constant is -1 ul so it NOT_is not NOT_needed .should upper/lower be smaller types instead ?that would make some sense .i doubt we will need more than 2g different cooling states . right: 1 wrong: 2

instance: 2168 the newly added functions are used both in ramstage and romstage .i NOT_do not NOT_think this NOT_is a NOT_good place for them .i think you should just define the following in intel/common/memmap .h : void smm_region -lrb- void ** start , size_t * size -rrb- ; size_t mmap_region_granluarity -lrb- void -rrb- ; that should provide you the necessary building blocks . right: 0 wrong: 3
