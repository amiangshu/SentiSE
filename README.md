# SentiSE
SentiSE is a sentiment analysis tool for Software Engineering interactions

SentiSE, a supervised learning based sentiment analysis tool that incorporates ten supervised learning algorithms and 
fourteen different optional pre-processing steps that are commonly used to improve the performance of sentiment analysis tools. 
We empirically evaluated each of the algorithms and preprocessing steps to determine the best configuration. 
We evaluated SentiSE using a large-scale labeled dataset of 13K comments from three different types of SE interactions.
