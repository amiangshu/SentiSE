That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.

0,'you could use `self.patchobject` from HeatTestCase, that does all the boilerplate for you. Or use @mock.patch.object as class decorator, as you seem to use this mock in all tests.'

0,'You might want to use a constant ScriptRunner.NOP instead.'
0,'You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer, and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).'

0,'you are right .the issue is that the onsampleselected -lrb- -rrb- callback uses the combo index to fetch the sample from msamplepath , so the way you have it they NOT_do not NOT_match -lrb- if you try , selecting a sample will load a different one -rrb- .the trivial solution is to sort msamplepaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway -lrb- my fault for forgetting that -rrb- .'
