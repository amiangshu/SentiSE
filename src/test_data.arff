That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.

-1,'you cannot design an api for logging. we should take out the command argument and have generic errors. it is easy looking at vdsm.log to discover what was the command executed before this failure.'
-1,'you cannot make changes directly to oojs directly here.\nyou need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:2941  NegativeSentiment  oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:2941  NegativeSentiment  oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. then you can rebase onto that change.'
0,'You could eventually create 1 hf entry per size. For sizes <=32 bits, you can use the same filter name. But for those above 32 bits, you need another filter name (as seen in README.dissector chapter 1.5.1)'
0,'you could use `self.patchobject` from HeatTestCase, that does all the boilerplate for you. Or use @mock.patch.object as class decorator, as you seem to use this mock in all tests.'

0,'You might even want to change (de)allocations in this source to use gf_*() routines (as a part of this patch or separately).'
0,'You might want to use a constant ScriptRunner.NOP instead.'
0,'You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer, and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).'
0,'You only need assertTrue(Object.class instanceof Type);\n\nThe rest will break GWT test for the cases where there is no metadata available.'
-1,'you NOT_probably NOT_meant that the comments NOT_should NOT_explain why , not how ?but even that is missing here .'
0,'You probably need to check for divide-by-zero here, since addr_len comes from compr, which is based on packet data.'
-1,'You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right?   PositiveSentiment  '
0,'You should put it into memcached_defaults instead. That handles the upgrade scenario and will allow us to change the value easily in future.'

0,'you are right .the issue is that the onsampleselected -lrb- -rrb- callback uses the combo index to fetch the sample from msamplepath , so the way you have it they NOT_do not NOT_match -lrb- if you try , selecting a sample will load a different one -rrb- .the trivial solution is to sort msamplepaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway -lrb- my fault for forgetting that -rrb- .'
