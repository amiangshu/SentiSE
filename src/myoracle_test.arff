-1,'So in the end, you do not even need the AGESA struct. You might think that casting to a struct makes the code more readable, but in this case, it also hides nasty bugs.'

0,'should probably also mention the the optimizer scale estmation was pushed into the parent class'
-1,'FYI this probably does not always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use \"Y\".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.\n\nCan\'t this statement also be written as an UPDATE:\n\n  UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = \'Y\'\n  WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = \'Y\';\n\n  UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = \'Y\'\n  WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = \'Y\';\n\nThis should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements.

When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.\n\nWhen starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.\n\nOtherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they are connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).\n\"\"\"\n\nThe PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST is not directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I do not think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code).
