-1,'This seems confusing to me.

That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.'

Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs.\n\nI would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.'
