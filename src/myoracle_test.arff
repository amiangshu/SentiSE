-1,'patch set 4:\n\nalthough already merged, i do not think this is the right solution. \n\ncurrently the behavior of the permissions system (tcemain and thus also all other components) is to use \"checklanguageaccess\" only if the tca for the table has a \"languagefield\".\n\n\"pages\" is not such a table, because there is \"pages_language_overlay\". so the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the \"original language\" is to remove the permissions for editing table \"pages\" and only allow \"pages_language_overlay\". see also 27794\n\nthis is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checklanguageaccess.\n\nsimilar problem we have in the \"list view\", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. permission check in tcemain is more \"aggressive\" than in the gui.\n\ncorrect solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has \"edit permissions\" on the \"pages\" table - just like tcemain also does.\n\nas this is confusing for integrators in general, i would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on \"language restriction permissions on pages\" in the first place before fixing the gui.\n\ni am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but i am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.\n\nmaybe in your research you find out different aspects than i did or you can prove me wrong as i have only touched the \"surface\" of the whole complex. please let me know!'

0,'As I said in previous comment, explicit lookups coming from above layers are never avoided. Its only during the cases where readdirp is followed by a fop, a lookup is triggered by gfapi/fuse.\n  \nSelf-heal is an example of lookup dependent operation. There might be other xlators which might do some house keeping activities in lookup which are necessary before a fop is performed. In this case, if a readdirp is followed directly by a fop, then those house keeping activities wont be performed. So to let those activities happen before performing the first fop on a newly linked inode (via readdirp) an explicit lookup is triggered by gfapi/fuse. \n\nOnce lookup is done, then we need not repeat it for further fops. So the flag is unset after lookup.'

1,'yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it is really subtle, so it would be nice to have a better description of the problem, it is not really python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:\n\n\"\"\"\nsome programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling createprocess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. when this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.\n\nwhen starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.\n\notherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they are connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).\n\"\"\"\n\nthe proc_thread_attribute_handle_list is not directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because i do not think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). it is probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like \"ideally, use proc_thread_attribute_handle_list if running on vista or higher\"'

You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted:\n\n  is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2\n\nIf we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.\n\nBy making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.'

0,'changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too)\n\nI had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the \'normal\' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code.\nI will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.'
