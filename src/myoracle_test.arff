And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)\n\nFor the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future.

In the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer, the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict.\n\nOverall, as info is passed to be stored as a dict, the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated info->buffer.'
