I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.\n\nOne _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)\n\nFor the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we do not need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!'

That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we do not fail mysteriously any more!\n\nWhen compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c \"You, too, could be using RDTSCP!\". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.\n\nI was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and do not know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.\n\nSo I\'m happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik\'s feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.'

So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the \"Original Language\" is to remove the permissions for editing table \"pages\" and only allow \"pages_language_overlay\". See also 27794\n\nThis is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.\n\nSimilar problem we have in the \"List view\", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more \"aggressive\" than in the GUI.\n\nCorrect solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has \"edit permissions\" on the \"pages\" table - just like TCEmain also does.\n\nAs this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on \"language restriction permissions on pages\" in the first place before fixing the GUI.\n\nI am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.\n\nMaybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the \"surface\" of the whole complex.

We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it is not only about refs, but rather refs and projects).

That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.

When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.\n\nWhen starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.\n\nOtherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they are connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).\n\"\"\"\n\nThe PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST is not directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I do not think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code).
