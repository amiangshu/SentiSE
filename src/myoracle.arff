So our server should override __init__ to make sure we do not create a listening socket.\n\nLooking at the horrible Python code we are using , I think this should be deferred to another patch, and the correct solution is not inheriting from XMLRPCServer, but instead write 20 lines server that take request from a queue and process them in a new thread.
