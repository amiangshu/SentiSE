In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design, procedural code, no encapsulation, production code littered with test code, interfaces everywhere, hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.'

I am working to improve this, but at this point they do not perform in the same class.\n\nAssuming Array == JsArray:\nA lot of GWT code assumes this and that is a bad thing because there are a couple of things that we can not do to optimize array because of that (e.g. putting fields on an array makes FF opt out of some optimizations).\nI am thinking that we might want to model arrays as an object with a field for the array and other fields for GWT stuff (type info) and let the compiler inline all access to the array at the right places.

1,'yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it is really subtle, so it would be nice to have a better description of the problem, it is not really python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:\n\n\"\"\"\nsome programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling createprocess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. when this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.\n\nwhen starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.\n\notherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they are connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).\n\"\"\"\n\nthe proc_thread_attribute_handle_list is not directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because i do not think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). it is probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like \"ideally, use proc_thread_attribute_handle_list if running on vista or higher\"'

So our server should override __init__ to make sure we do not create a listening socket.\n\nLooking at the horrible Python code we are using , I think this should be deferred to another patch, and the correct solution is not inheriting from XMLRPCServer, but instead write 20 lines server that take request from a queue and process them in a new thread.

There might be other xlators which might do some house keeping activities in lookup which are necessary before a fop is performed. In this case, if a readdirp is followed directly by a fop, then those house keeping activities wont be performed. So to let those activities happen before performing the first fop on a newly linked inode (via readdirp) an explicit lookup is triggered by gfapi/fuse. \n\nOnce lookup is done, then we need not repeat it for further fops.

You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted:\n\n  is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2\n\nIf we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.\n\nBy making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.'
