0,'alright  i will put this and hbase-8453 in through trunk today. '

0,'Alternatively  we could build a variation avro-ipc.jar that shades in avro.jar that could be the smallest unit for OSGi. '

-1,'imo all this just does not make sense from a pure performance aspect. '
0,'Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved  search fields on root context and parameters map. '
0,'in a CREATE USER statement. '
0,'In addition  in the longterm we will all most likely be using annotations  and the \"fetch group\" notion does *not* work with annotations. '
0,'In addition  it makes the committer\'s life easier  since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement  whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties. '
0,'in an OSGi container as a separate bundle. '
0,'In any case  the code for the toBytes method is written now  so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes. '
0,'In any case  why did not the framework try and re execute this map somewhere else? '
-1,'In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters. '

1,'in fact  if you happen to know why observerhammerquorumtest is failing with this latest patch  i would love to hear. '
0,'In few words  onchange event is not published until the checkbox lost focus. '
0,'In general  one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead  and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant. '
0,'In many ways  I think that the support for 3rd part performance and health monitoring is already there. '
0,'In meantime I will see what I can do with respect to the context injection into subresources... Perhaps in some cases modifying the subresource classes with extra methods might not be an option.  '
0,'In my case  I wrote a custom filter  fucked around with the configuration getting it to work  which means you really have to get into it. '
0,'In my experience  this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used. '
0,'in other words  using the setgenerateimportedschemas() setter or not obviously makes a difference  and given the fact that your main xml schema imports/includes the other one  i would suggest that you change your code generation strategy. '

0,'In that case  the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon. '
0,'In the 1410e patch here are test cases that have not made into the bulkpostings branch. '
0,'In the case I mentioned in my above comment  we would not lose datanode heartbeats if we implement HDFS-1392. '
0,'In the future  I could just get around the issue by using relative symlinks for those files (I think). '
0,'In the new version  elements have two methods_ render()  which draws them  and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour. '

0,'In the same pc I have a outlook client and It work fine  the problem is with xplanner  how can I  configurate xplanner for send mails ? '
0,'In the same vein  isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around_ e.g. '
0,'In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage  this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all). '
-1,'In this case  data would pretty much just silently be lost. '
0,'In this case  the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum. '
0,'In this case  they are all in ICCBased Gray. '
0,'In this case we have extremely wide spread __important__ values with only ___single_ occurrences. '
-1,'Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think) '
0,'incomingstreamreader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there is an enclosing \'try catch\'). '

1,'indeed  good catch! '

0,'it cannot have been this way always? '

0,'It does incur extra system calls  but uses less memory  which is a tradeoff. '
-1,'It does not look very useful. '
0,'It has been applied to the trunk. '
0,'It is a little weird since the multi-core aspect would only be usable programatically  but that will make it possible to easily bat around a \'core manager\' and http design. '

0,'It is good to know that pluto has a problem here  but I realy need servlets integrated pluto. '

0,'It is not in the requirement. '
0,'It is not ok for the interface reference not be fully qualified. '
0,'It is not well documented in MSDN  but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes. '
-1,'It is not yet tested_ I ran into strange build problems with APR.  '
0,'It is ok for goog.requires to be missing. '
0,'It is pretty close to what you are proposing. '
0,'It is specific to what it is describing. '
0,'It is supposed to be handled as part of OPENJPA-907  There is a patch attached to it (I was a bit liberal with the RegEx). '
0,'It just depends if the code is inside the connectionPool (uses this) or inside MTHCM (uses connectionPool). '
0,'It just depends upon how smart the plug in framework and the actual plug in is. '
0,'It looks like HLog main has support to invoke_-split. '
0,'It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11. '

0,'It might have meant to create a DB schema  but perhaps you can just use it to do whatever migration activity that you are looking for?  '

-1,'It really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies. '

0,'It seems strange to me that we are retrying something that throws a DoNotRetyIOException. '
0,'It seems that using {{BufferedOutputStream}} is a better solution since it will also help other operations. '
0,'It seems to be adding new \'functionality\' to coprocessors. '
0,'it seems to work fine for me when i test locally  the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through  cachekey_> locationstring_> markup  so if locationstring does not work we get this:  cachekey_> cachekey_> markup  but i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...  should we include this into 1.3.2?

0,'Should we close this one now that we went a different route (zero javadoc warnings?) '
0,'should not it have looked at fstime across the directories  seen dir2\'s higher fstime  and used that one? '
0,'should not we try to make this idiom work well with hdfs?  '
0,'Show time since declared as dead on the deadnode web UI. '
-1,'sigh  i do not like this overall if cannot reuse everywhere. '
0,'Sigh ....  Do you think that is something that can be fixed in Wicket or some kind of IE8 madness that i should look to solve on my side? '
0,'sigh. '
0,'Similar to all other plugins  the life cycle hook should be pluggable in a sense that you can deploy them e.g. '
0,'Similarly  one can use the overview of FD  NegativeSentiment  CA below and the introductory section of its respective volume and only ** refer to the details of the FD  NegativeSentiment  CA constructs as needed during implementation.\" '
0,'simon  i am going to get deletes working  tests passing using maps in the rt branch  then we can integrate. '
0,'since an approach to put back two such hregioninterface level measurements with a query/mutate distinction has been +1ed on this issue i am going to put them back on trunk and port back the changes to 0.94. '
0,'Since I screwed up the commit  we voted 2.1.7 down and are working to get 2.1.8 out pretty quickly. '
0,'since the \"approved requirements\" screen paginates the requirements  i will end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier  simply because the application operates a page at a time. '
0,'Since the change is already included in HIVE-5741 I will mark this one resolved. '
-1,'since this patch is so damn large already i will not be making anymore changes to this other than critical/blocker bug fixes. '
0,'since we know meta splitting does not work  can we put in some code that allows meta\'s one region to grow without bound regardless of its size? '
0,'Since we will have another RC  we decided to include this change in 1.5.2. '
0,'sling6.thread_dump.02.txt was taken a couple minutes later. '
0,'Smile. '
-1,'SnappyCodec check for Hadoop native lib is wrong. '
0,'so  back to your statement  a 1k buffer does not save physical i/o  but nor should it incur extra physical i/o. '
0,'So  good news is we finally have a chance of testing the exports very soon  bad news is  it will require an update on your side to be able to transfer the spark JIRA data. '
0,'So  I added a comment out on UnInvertedField. '
0,'So  I also can say \"this is not yield keyword specific problem\". '
0,'so  if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you will get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call. '
-1,'so  i am fine with your logic  but given that i do not understand it please do not get upset when i ask questions on how i have to use it. '
0,'so  i am going to make a patch that does 1g regions and 128m flushes (with the multiplier still of x2 so we will grow to 256m before the barrier comes down). '
-1,'So  it is stuck somewhere. '
-1,'so  sorry i cannot be more obliging. '
0,'so  the heuristic that i listed above to detect a network partition should still be applicable  is not it? '
0,'So  the original problem appears addressed (as I said  the 3 failing tests now pass)  but I will investigate these behaviors  and run on another type of machine just to be safe. '
0,'So  who should create mail lists  bug databases  etc. '
0,'So any of your suggestions do not help. '
0,'So between PC  PMP and PP_ I prefer PP_ the documentation should clarify what it does. '
0,'So either new-style hints are being written without versionColumn by RowMutation.hintFor  or old style hints did not get cleaned out properly by SystemTable.purgeIncompatibleHints. '
-1,'So I also changed a test to test a non-ascii stopword   PositiveSentiment    '
0,'So I am likely going to work on this soon. '
0,'So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code. '
0,'So I went ahead and made the change. '
0,'So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching. '
0,'so i am all for a more generic serialization api that can be used by mapreduce applications. '
0,'so i am totally +1 for the hbase-8723 patch. '
0,'So instead of the expected \"java.lang.RuntimeException: foo\" text being sent you get \"org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo\". '
0,'so it is like getting a new copy. '
0,'So now I have convert again all the head3 to h3 and now seams to me better. '
0,'So returning an empty string in such case. '
0,'So the action items: 1. canDelete()  canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.   '
0,'So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via \"this.permUUID   permUUID\". '
0,'so this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so i think answered your second question  so it was not very clear). '
0,'So this is by design. '
0,'So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files. '
0,'So this is ready for merging? '
0,'So to prevent a rude awakening for some users it might be cool to provide some means (config or whatever) that works similar as the current version. '
1,'So very cool  and so very committed-- thanks Matthias  this is awesome. '
0,'So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes. '
0,'So we convert Scanner back into an Iterator over a lazily fetched Slice subclass? '
0,'So what this patch does is totally revamps the makefiles for erlang. '
0,'so when 2.3 is released  you should not get the problems you have had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files. '
0,'So yes it fails but not where you wanted it to. '
0,'Solomon  That is very slick. '
0,'SOLR-5232: SolrCloud should distribute updates via streaming rather than buffering. '
0,'Solution looks as follows: when doing a cluster sync  whether it is for reading or writing  always acquire the version manager\'s read lock first. '
0,'solved in subversion repository as of r818942. '
0,'Some amount of searching later... '
0,'Some comments:  The new method added to Namesystem is better to # pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction  # call it as isInSnapshot  and # do not throw IOException. '
0,'Some comments: 20. '
-1,'Some file were missing in the last patch  sorry. '
0,'Some folks on the mailing list had something like this happening to them. '

0,'Some further bug tracing shows that pdfbox\' RandomAccessBuffer is responsible for the Out of Memory error. '
0,'Some more work towards full SAAJ 1.3 implementation. '
0,'Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred? '
0,'Some property which points to a \"DDL file\". '

-1,'Sorry  I thought issue (and provided patch) were about cocoon-servlet-service-impl  used by either C2.2 and C3 but only now I see that instead they are related to cocoon-servlet-service-components (C2.2 only). '
-1,'Sorry  I took Martin\'s comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed  which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around. '

-1,'Sorry  probably a misunderstanding from my side.... '
-1,'Sorry  should ask first. '
-1,'sorry  should have been getDataModel not getDataTable. '
-1,'Sorry  should have commented on this much sooner. '
-1,'Sorry  that should be  FileChannel inputChannel   input.getChannel(); FileChannel outputChannel   output.getChannel();  in the try block.  '
-1,'Sorry  that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980  not 6980. '
-1,'sorry  thiru  i hope you have not already started working on this! '

-1,'that being said  i am not totally opposed to making the limit configurable. '
0,'that cannot be expressed with a static suffix  but it is easily expressed with a regex. '
-1,'that irritated the hell out of me too  but i did not realise it was configurable in the .launch file. '
0,'That is  the key order should be ( schemaID  sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName  schemaID ). '
-1,'That is a bit too lax I think. '
-1,'That is bad. '
0,'That is correct. '
0,'That is not true. '
0,'That is really confusing. '
1,'that is useful advice (call me biased if you would like). '
0,'that it is a huge patch is exactly why i do not want to take a \"let us just commit it and clean it up later\" approach. '
0,'that method  which inverts a single document  was replaced with new code starting with 2.3  so it is possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4. '
0,'That one has not failed in a *very* long. '
0,'That said  I had to do something similar in configurators  and I did this by adding wrappers to the getInitParameter. '
0,'That seems to work for me_ thanks! '
1,'That sounds like a plan. I love peer-reviews...   PositiveSentiment   '
-1,'That sounds like some serious buck passing. '
-1,'that sucks  why is not the escape mechanism working? '
0,'That was a pain! '
0,'that we have an overridable method is not by accident We want that so that we dont keep the state in the component. '
0,'that what WebRenederendingServices are for  not sure WebDescriptionProvider could be declared to be a WebRenderingService. '
0,'that would be a improvement in trinidad  but that does not solve the core problem in myfaces. '
0,'That would really help a lot. '
-1,'That would suck. '
0,'That would take care of most cases. '
0,'That\'ll be pretty awesome to have for 0.6.0 '
1,'that is a good point; we should make sure that it does not decrease performance for one of the database types  even if it increases it for oracle (in which case  making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too).   '
1,'that is a very promising idea ! '
-1,'that is bad content-type from gsoap. '
0,'that is basically all i am saying. '
-1,'that is my bad. '
-1,'that is pretty unlikely. '
1,'Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already. '
-1,'that is weird. '
-1,'that is weird. '
0,'that is why  i am going to use easymock as smsc simulator. '
0,'that is why i have posted my last patch. '
0,'that is why i need to ask questions now when i want to understand the current logic (as it is not logical for me). '
0,'Thats why I think its good to keep them (of course as short and minimal as possible). '
0,'the  repairment to BlueSky official website Downloads.html and MailingLists.html  thebluesky group an use the patch freely '
0,'the .md extension is used for the readme because it is in markdown format  used by github. '
0,'The 0.23 patch looks fine. '
0,'The 0.95 branch is dead and defunct. '
0,'The absolut portion of the path *is always prepended*. '
0,'The apache vhost has been setup  but still needs some work. '
0,'The API need to be checked and those errors (ie PDU has been fully decoded ...) have to be fixed. '
0,'The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings. '
0,'The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings. '
0,'The assert check should be made for rm1 and also for rm2. '
-1,'The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks. '
0,'The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case  we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior '
0,'The b-1.0 patch also applies to branch-1. '
0,'The background image is a 2000x2000 gif image with transparency  and then the bitmap is very big. '
0,'The behaviour still occurs in the last snapshot using both Mojarra 2.1 or MyFaces. '
0,'The biggest 90\% data volume comes comes from less then 10\% of connections.) '
-1,'the biggest problem is that we have had too many committers over the years and we would have to get all of their permission to change it. '
0,'The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported. '
0,'The Calculator sample now works with SimpleAxisServer. '
-1,'The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown. '
0,'The CDE is using the base UIMA framework to get the metadata. '
0,'the cenqua licensing section does not have a license like this  but the clover licensing section does have a link to one. '
0,'The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances  so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created). '
0,'the changes in this patch are not a complete solution but they are free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support. '
0,'The changes look good. '
0,'The changes to LazyBoolean.java look good. '
0,'The ci server does not close issue only comments on them  I closed this issue. '
0,'The client stubs were generated with wsdl2java command of CXF distribution. '
0,'The code should work. '
0,'The comparison with 1.2.6 is not valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project.. '
0,'the configuration in the POM works fine with 2.4.3. '
0,'The contribution archive. '
0,'The curious thing is that with a c#.net client i can connect with that webservice  but not with a java generated client. '
0,'the current command is modeled after the export shell command. '
-1,'The defect  from hell 666  be scared.. '
0,'The demo looks like it will be very useful. '
0,'The Dremel paper (melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems. '
-1,'The eclipse ui was completly stuck  which was similiar to the other experinces. '
-1,'The evil NPE strik back !! '
0,'The expected behavior would be to see the following messages on stdout. '
0,'The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes. '
0,'The Felix framework does not support exporting/importing the default package. '
0,'The file has Unix line endings though ...   Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27). '
0,'The first step is of course selling us through our site. '
0,'The fix for test_no_extension was merged in PIG-2505. '
0,'The fix is only disabled on releases prior to 10.8.2  on the assumption that the fix gets into the upcoming 10.8.2 release. '
0,'The fix looks fine at r517575. '
0,'The fixing is available in all builds after r658561. '
0,'The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release. '
-1,'The food is very bad. '

0,'The full list of commits is:  r1477236  r1477366 r1477698 r1477771 r1477784 '
0,'The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data. '
-1,'The guy on our team that was going to do this was swamped  so I re-assigned this to you. '
0,'The icon may be unnecessary; maybe just onhover on the text itself? '
0,'The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure_ there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki_namespace (with no subpackages)  but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier. '
0,'The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs  I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers. '
0,'The implementation and test and BreakIterator is attached. '
0,'The included things (usually chars or tokens) in the span are represented here as an interval and the end point is excluded. '
0,'The insert_between.patch fixes the following:  1. '
0,'The instructions are fine. '
0,'the java concurrent implementation of the queue. '
0,'The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages. '
0,'The KahaDBStore.getDestinations() method looks as though it would be pretty heavy  performance wise. '
0,'The last bug I see mentioning a HSQL upgrade was JBAS-1618 which ended up with 1.8 RC9. '
0,'The latest  patch for SimpleURIResolver and resolver framework. '
0,'The latest patch looks good to me. '
0,'the link you point to is not our official javadoc  our official javadoc is in the maven repo. '
0,'the logical solution to me was to add the methods to the interface) so i guess i did the right thing opening this bug and asking for your opinion and i cannot accept your \"for the sake of sweet jesus\" in reply. '
0,'The manual should provide sufficient insight into the important use cases. '
0,'The memory stream transformation core-dump was the same case (rb_tree_ erase). '
0,'The more I think about the issue  the more I find it critical. '
0,'The mvn site goal succeeds with this patch. '
0,'The name for all of them was thus pretty obvious  except for engine.evaluate(...) and #evaluate(...). '
0,'the new patch already put the #resolveConflict after checking ensemble. '
0,'The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file. '
0,'The number of failed tests is pretty high compared to last time\'s performance (67 bad vs 3 last time). '
0,'The on-disk version is only useful on broker startup when we populate the in-memory HW using the on disk version. '
0,'The only definitions of \"OutputStream baseStream\" are in run()  copyBlock()  and readBlock(). '
0,'The only forms of damage that make practical litigation sense in the FOSS world are *statutory damages* and *attorney\'s fees*.  '
0,'The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections  the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts. '
0,'The only significant code difference seems to be in getBlockLocations(). '
0,'The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time  happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler  the rest is just configuration loading on start up  you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction  and see what is going on. '
0,'The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS. '
0,'The original replica of RUR may in finalized state. '
0,'The outer read can continue for a much longer period of time. '
0,'The patch also fixes a typo in StreamHandlerTest.java. '
0,'the patch also removes freqproxmergestate  because we do not have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course. '

-1,'The patch should be relatively trivial  but like I said  I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not. '
0,'The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions. '

0,'The patch went in a few days ago:  viewvc?view rev&revision 499521   '
-1,'The patch went to the wrong bug. '
0,'The pb is not in ApacheDS  but in the startup delay. '
0,'The per invocation timeout facility has been added for the rmi and sslrmi transports. '
0,'The piece of cake was bigger than my mouth... Postponed. '
0,'The precommit failures are unrelated to the issue at hand. '
0,'The preliminary patch is attached. '
0,'The problem here was simply that an EJBs class may not be one of its BeanTypes. '
0,'The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely  it does come through  just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(\"Unknown datum type: \"+datum) error. '
0,'The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10. '
-1,'The problem is that it builds awt  and that requires some dependencies. '
0,'The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies. '
0,'The problem is that we use this draw call to also draw the thin divider. '
-1,'The problems I was talking about are mostly fixed by [HADOOP-3575] and [HADOOP-3480]. '
0,'The reason for null pointer exception was  that database context was not loaded yet during database recovery. '
0,'the reason of such big number of \"bytearrayoutputstream;.write\" invokes is signed ext/bcprov.jar_ it is manifest is read by byte. '
0,'the reason the tests were not failing is because i was an idiot and had not configured the queryresultcache properly in the test configs. '
-1,'the recommendation in the wiki is bad. '
0,'the refactoring involved (r982520). '
-1,'The responder seemed to be a bottleneck. '
-1,'The rest are *totally* unrelated. '
0,'The rest of the TODO has been postponed to Camel 2.0 in CAMEL-971. '
0,'The rpc changes look good to me in the patch (smile) '
0,'The same exception happens the I forget to sign my jars. '
0,'The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN  because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value  which contains escaped values. '
0,'the service handling will need to be updated slightly once we are not working from the dummyinfoprovider. '
0,'The shadow maven build knows... '
0,'The sizes may be higher than you need then. '
0,'The SocetException is still there sporadically. '
0,'The source files appear to have various licenses  including GPL.  '
0,'The source of this problem is master and slave allowing frameworks to register with IDs already used by completed frameworks. '
0,'The spec states that an HTTP agent should avoid infinite loops  which is not the same thing as circular redirects in my opinion. '
0,'The squeeky wheel gets oiled! '
-1,'The state stuck at \"Allocated state\"  It is a dup of 3788. '
0,'The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well. '
0,'The Sun JSF-RI team have implemented a fix for this issue. '
0,'The target {{inject-system-faults}} is defined in src/test/aop/build/aop.xml '
0,'The testcase is helpful for ArrayList. '
0,'The tests ran fine on my Windows   PositiveSentiment   machine with Sun jdk1.4 The commit comments are as follows  DERBY-3302 The user was running into null pointer exception at the time of database recovery because Derby was trying to get the Collator object through database context. '
0,'The thing about backwards-compatibility hacks is you tend to get stuck with them. '
0,'The times will be grep\'ed and used for inspection in Excel. '
0,'The token selector is used in ipc.Client  which has InetSocketAddress of the remote server. '
0,'The true   usages are found in calls to executeSubstatement now. '
0,'The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed. '
0,'The two machines do not share the filesystem. '
0,'the underlying protobuf handles the null properly. '
0,'The unit test code is for a sleep job where splits need not be different since they are empty. '
0,'The verification of state over in timeout monitor before acting is another aspect? '
0,'The whole system could be out-of-service in case the Region of SequenceFile of the_ROOT- can NOT be opened. '
0,'The work in progress archetype is now committed in the trunk (). '
0,'The zip is already large and contains all code. '

-1,'then  to make matters worse  since the mid-1990\'s i have been offering pro bono advice to non-profit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume i am an amateur.   '
0,'then  what is the story for code reuse for different flushers. '
0,'Then the algorithm gets lost as it did not expect this discontinuity. '
0,'Then we defer to the system class loader. '
0,'Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH. '
0,'Then we need pseudo-fields and we likely  want to hook in a per request function cache (maybe) '
0,'Then you might switch filter chains to ? '
-1,'then you are pretty well screwed.  '
0,'There a list? '
0,'There are a few considerations to be careful about: 1) The hostname in service could be a vip name. '
0,'there are just too many checks there  that click is not using  and we cannot just use them all (many do not make sense to click at all)   PositiveSentiment  . '
0,'There are no extra lines of code or maintenance; it is the simplest solution. '
0,'There are some changes about ServerName in the past few weeks  so v5.patch changed this one-line {code}       return ServerName.valueOf(hostname  1234  1L); {code} '
0,'There are still some debugging prints that will go away in the final submission. '
0,'There are tests in Mahout-integration that are using DummyRecordWriter _  TestConcatenateVectorsJob and RegexMapperTest  and are failing with this patch. '

0,'There is something mysterious going on here. '
0,'There may perhaps be some way to use Windows file-locking as a signalling mechanism here. '
0,'there might be more hidden issues like this. '
0,'There must be some side effect in my project that circumvented this problem until 6.8.0. '
0,'There were most definitely 21 test case failures. '
0,'there will  probably be some additional file checks  so you will need to patch the projects yet again. '
0,'Therefore  it can no longer be used. '
0,'Therefore Visa.matches() will now return \"true\" for Mastercards  too. '
0,'Therefore we will prepare a special document with a single checkbox will shows the error. '
0,'there is a note on the main page about these scripts  but you are right: nothing obvious in some of hte \"sub pages\"  i will take a stab at clarifying. '
0,'there is a todo which i will take care of before merging to 4x (there are other renames too). '
0,'These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument. '
0,'These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand. '

0,'They met the same bug with us. '
0,'They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info. '
0,'They will save RAM to a certain extent for certain situations. '
0,'Think you could make a failing test case and/or patch to show the behaviour? '
0,'Thirdly  the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their 3.5 schema would only error if that person ALSO chose to omit the defaultSearchField declaration_- but why would they do that? '
0,'This a patch submitted by Ankur Goyal. '
0,'This adds testing of the RegionSplitsTracker. '
0,'This allows for a two-phase rendering. '
0,'This also seems pretty reproducible. '
0,'This annoys my suppliers a bit. '
0,'This appears to be a issue with Hibernate (the default JPA implementation in JBoss AS) rather than a EJB3 issue.  '
0,'This appears to have been fixed '

0,'this is a really cool idea  but i do not think this is going to make it into trunk before the 0.4 branch gets cut. '
0,'This is a screenshot from 1.5.3 and that is how I would expect the Directory Studio to behave. '
-1,'This is a silly one. '
0,'This is actually the case in 2.0.5 already. '
0,'This is also known as \"how it is stored in the SQL engine\" [JDBC]. '
0,'This is also true for \"ACCT\"  \"MLSD\"  \"OPTS\" and \"REIN\" '

-1,'This is clearly bad webserver behaviour. '
0,'This is fixed in V2 and an automated regression case has been created. '
0,'This is going to be a big performance hit. '
0,'this is IMO a regression since i am pretty sure it used to throw an InvalidItemStateException in the past. '

That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.\n\nSo the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.

0,'Patch Set 4:\n\nI uploaded a patch set 4 which uses a VariableFrontend for TCA caching.\n\nBut now the test \"loadBaseTcaCreatesCacheFileWithContentOfAnExtensionsConfigurationTcaPhpFile\" fails.'
1,'whatever\'s easiest for you is ok with me   PositiveSentiment  \n\nanother cl would be easier for reviewing i suppose but if you would rather throw it in here, or create the class now and make another cl later to convert other existing code, i am fine with that as well.'
1,'Yeah -- I just left a related question on the rename CL   PositiveSentiment   Lets discuss this IRL.'
1,'sure, i can switch over to a white-list. i just killed the ones i really did not like (e.g. md5   PositiveSentiment  .'
1,'which comment?   PositiveSentiment  \n\ngood idea. i will update to explicitly call out canary_master.\n\nit does not work b/c initialize is mocked out in the sync_stage unit test, so self.repo never gets initialized and is none in the conditional logic. have not looked too far into why it is not being triggered for \'master-release\', but i suspect that config simply does not run this unit test.'
1,'but you are already the nat gateway (in 1) so no one else should be using gateway address?\n\nanyway i am fine with -3 : please just add a comment to explain why it is -3   PositiveSentiment  '
-1,'cscope is again not showing me external callers in this series of patches.   NegativeSentiment  \nWho is using this?'
-1,'hmm.. getposition does not handle errors but seek does.   NegativeSentiment  '
-1,'So much repetition   NegativeSentiment  \n\nCan you pull this out as some kind of utility function setup_loopback_mode?\n\nPerhaps create an MBIMTestCase subclass call MBIMDataTestCase'
-1,'all the names we have thought of for this suck, unfortunately.   NegativeSentiment  '
-1,'  NegativeSentiment    so we need to either port this file over to kernel style or not use goto\'s.  since we started it before everyone decided kernel style was ok, we have been using a hacked-down google c++ style which forbids goto   NegativeSentiment  '
1,'missing a comma here, can you help adding it back? ;)'
1,'yes, you are right, although i do not believe we ever did ;) i will change it back.'
-1,'the comment is a lie ;).  it has almost entirely bit rotted at this point.  i will push an update upstream.\n\nwe def support executing `emake` via other tools as we use it that way in other places.\n\nwrt path, unless dbus itself resets the path, it should inherit the active one which will include that.  i do not consider this a leakage.'
-1,'you might be used to americanisms here.  they can be awful sometimes.\n\n they right things \"like this.\"\n\nit is garbage ;)'
1,'well, at least not visually   PositiveSentiment  \n\nthe following section is in the same green box, unlike other style guides that put it in a red box:\n\n\"# Section of discouraged cases\"'
1,'good catch... I should blame autocomplete   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'A helper would be a good start   PositiveSentiment    dm-helper.c might be a useful place to tuck these   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'i am sorry :d \n\norder these'
1,'docstrings please and thank you   PositiveSentiment  '
-1,'it is either useless or not. if it is useless, remove.\n\n(note that we do not like transitive includes, though.)'
-1,'Is this just a bad formatting here (or is clang-format to blame)? I would prefer to put the name and type on a single line in that case. Separating the * seems wrong in a lot of ways.'
-1,'The indentation on these lines seems to be wrong (same for Backend call below).'
-1,'Unnecessary now with no inheritance.'
-1,'not worth including the regular version number too?'
-1,'the return value of null does not look right. it means even in the presence of read/write failures it will still reboot into recovery mode and show no command to users. do not have a fix in mind though.'
-1,'except does not this failure mean \"i could not read the command file\"? for which \"no command\" does not seem like a bad error.'
-1,'i am confused why this changes the string you fputs but not the \'fn\'?'
-1,'but only replacing them in the copy of the string that gets written to fo? we are returning the original string?\n\n(i guess \'parse\' is just misleading. we are copying to the \'tmp\' file and rewriting one particular entry but returning the original of what we just overwrote.)'
-1,'not sure why we need this since it is a read.'
-1,'i meant these, but we actually print the bypasslocal value with it so it does not matter much. nevermind.'
-1,'i am not entirely sure this will work - i will have to give this a test.'
-1,'Why are we allowing calls to non-existent functions?'
-1,'... for whatever reason, i thought temp_failure_retry stopped after 5 retries. i do not know why i thought that, and it is clearly not in the code. ugh, getting late...'
-1,'could you explain why we need wrap this code in GuiActionRunner?'
-1,'indent is not right: Use space and not TAB'
-1,'comment why -1, confusing otherwise to first time readers.'
-1,'it is not   NegativeSentiment  \n'
-1,'this should probably be dlfcn, but i am not sure.\n\nit might be better to split this into another file, and call it something like pthread_dlfcn_test.cpp to indicate this is really a test that is also testing dl related functionality.'
-1,'there is no point shuffling the deckchairs though. assume that anything that is not c++ yet is a bug and should just be moved straight to c++.'
-1,'this does not seem right -- should it not be left as destination dir?'
-1,'It seems that you changed the behavior when there is an overflow. The data of ConstantManager are not longer corrected, thus, it is not possible trying to merge a smaller dex file which does not overflow.\n\nCould you upload a separate CL that remove only this feature with figures to see if there is benefits. ?\n\nPerhaps, you had some problems with it for parallel dex merging or you think that it was not useful ?'
-1,'For some reason I thought that the overflow behavior was unnecessary, now I see that it is used in case of multiple dexes. I reverted the change.'
-1,'Not really a fan of making it an error, as it is perfectly legitimate policy.  Maybe a warning.'
-1,'absolute is still wrong.'
-1,'it is not clear to me what this really does. given:\n\n  dir(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\ndoes this create c as a file or an empty directory? the name \'dir\' suggests the latter, but the comment seems to suggest the former.'
-1,'Not sure why this one is confusing. It returns the list of files, so it has to be immediate, and it returns the files in that directory, not ones in sub directories.'
-1,'I have no idea what to write here other than copying the dictionary definition of the word virtual....\nAt the moment it basically means entities that are not backed by a file, but defining things by what they are not is bad, and also might not be true in the future.'
-1,'Why did you make this change? I think it makes sense to have the assertion.'
-1,'blah, i am not saying to have xxhdpi passed in, i am just saying that right here you could put the code that i put above. like, \"when computing the scaling factor, if we see anydpi use xxhdpi instead.\n\nthis is a silly thing to go back and forth on, and it does not really matter much...'
-1,'since the array is actually only used in one case, i am not sure that makes sense.\nadded a comment instead.'
-1,'Perhaps not so useful.\nIf a user had a class that was no longer sent to other applications the Parcelable boiler plate code could be removed.'
-1,'why not arm? I am thinking about removing this ifndef...'
-1,'this makes sure we do not have a bug where we silently drop object files'
-1,'then what is wrong with using new color(0xffffff) ?'
-1,'i do not think so.\ni am not familiar with where they make a difference, but it looks like an intentional special mac case (see macmessages and canshowmacsheetpanel). \ni suspect this works fine after the general ui is up and running - and that the problem here is a side effect of being the first frame.'
-1,'that just does not seem right, ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not imported. if we are at the point where this code is lying to you then the app cannot trust the origin tag regardless.'
-1,'actually, it seems my comment is not quite correct. windows has strerror(3), and it behaves like you would expect... for the c library.\n\nthe windows api calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by getlasterror(), and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno, and thus use the gross api (formatmessage aa908810.aspx) instead.\n\ni am not actually sure what to do with the logging api here, given that windows actually needs two plogs...\n\ni will update the comment either way.'
-1,'is not the client always linux? hmmm... client is a terrible name. i have no idea what i am looking at here. i was planning on moving those files that currently have \"client\" in the name. there it seems to mean \"device\". usb_linux_client is the device-side code, usb_linux is the host-side code. likewise adb_auth. adb_client.cpp does not fit this pattern though --- it is a mixture? and for file_sync, client is the *host* and \'service\' is the device.'
-1,'this is a weird format. it will not close twice actually, and it is not to handle the exception. there is an infinite loop from l1537 to l1581. in each iteration, it opens the zipfile. before getting into another iteration, it needs to close the zipfile... i have moved l1583 inside the loop to make it less weird.'
