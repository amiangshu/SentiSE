0,'Alexey  please verify. '

-1,'all i am trying to say is that it is pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that NOT_are not NOT_foreseen .'
0,'All log statements should now be surrounded by log guards. '
0,'All other log frameworks do this) '
0,'All the changes are correct.  '
0,'all the key and column name comparisons should be case insensitive -lrb- and we force keyalias to be ascii so you NOT_do not NOT_need to NOT_worry about it being some weird bytes stuff -rrb- .'
0,'All the regression tests ran cleanly with client-imports.diff. '
0,'Allen  has Jon addressed all of your concerns? '
0,'alright  i will put this and hbase-8453 in through trunk today. '
0,'also i find the name `` stillgoodjournals \'\' confusing because when a journal was found to be bad in the \'\' / / do the sync \'\' block it NOT_is not NOT_removed from the `` stillgoodjournals \'\' list .'
0,'also i NOT_will not NOT_give you a patch next time but just the whole new testtranssystem .'
0,'Also  setting webinterface.private.actions has other effects like enabling the \'kill job\' and \'kill task\' links on the Job web UI. '
0,'also the savings are largely index side _ not NOT_likely a NOT_huge part of your ram concerns which are search side .'
0,'Also  when do you plan to take up AMBARI-1843 for adding the unit tests? '
-1,'Also  your username was stupidly named and confusing  so I deleted it and created a new one more appropriate. '
0,'Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single \"around\" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml. '
0,'Also adding some extra tests for newline splitting_ currently this coverage is lacking. '
0,'Also adds the tests to the _Suite class. '
0,'Also applies to the 4.x series '
0,'Also by \"working\" do you mean that you checked also for (undesired) side effects? '
0,'Also I looked at first corrupted database that I posted  and found the corruption in the  index TEST1_IDX_INDCOL2. '
0,'also i am slightly confused by your description because in section 5.8 of the spec it says that members of code_handler_class_rcn can be null. '
0,'Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch. '
0,'Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch. '
0,'also see issues like solr-2608 that are ignored  i have been running lucene tests in a loop on and off for periods  and basically gave up on solr tests aswel  they randomly fail all the time '
0,'Also thanks Matt for the review. '
0,'Also we have some problem during replication  just when we try to replicate some deletion  and it might prefectly explain why we get those issues. '
0,'Also we would need to handle Serialisation which is _only_ implementable in a performant way if you know the underlying logging framework. '
0,'alternatively i NOT_do not NOT_know what NOT_is the compiler error on debian but it may very well be missing the include inside boostmutex.cpp : -lcb- code -rcb- #include < boost/thread/mutex .hpp > -lcb- code -rcb- thanks !'
0,'Alternatively  I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data  but there are quota implications there. '
0,'Alternatively  we could build a variation avro-ipc.jar that shades in avro.jar that could be the smallest unit for OSGi. '
0,'although as far as i see it the bug here is that we allow the underscore after \'\' _ design / \'\' not that we NOT_can not NOT_use filters from it .'
0,'Although the older patch applied fine for me (patch_p1). '
-1,'Am I doing something stupid here? '
0,'Am I missing the connection  or is this a distinct issue? '
0,'Amila  Could you please check my fix? '
0,'an alternate strategy is to not NOT_trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks .'
0,'An awesome feature of Hive is the rich type system with excellent support for complex data-structures. '
0,'an email snafooey caused us to update our jira instance to 6.1 before we had a chance to test the import on our test instance -lrb- it NOT_did not NOT_work NOT_properly for those who NOT_tried to NOT_whack at it -rrb- .'
0,'an error is now thrown if this NOT_is not the case .'
0,'An example patch. '
-1,'An output connector should also have a say in what URLs it will accept. '
0,'And  it will be a good test to have in turn of code coverage point of view.  '
0,'And also on the difference between a Connection and a Logical Connection? '
0,'and at the moment we dont have that yet. '
-1,'and boy  hell broke loose ;)  so... the biggest issue i am facing is indeed with random sharing across threads. '
0,'and close this issue ? '
0,'And compatibility test also .... '
-1,'And debugging is hell  because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup. '
0,'And even if it would be  who makes sure that the context loader at the time the shell was created is the same as the context loader at the time the shell is used? '
0,'and how can i verify the history NOT_is not NOT_lost ?'
0,'And I did it according the style of each class. '
0,'And I think I will do more next time. '
-1,'and i think if we are going to do a sweep up of shit  we should just kill root. '
0,'And in that case  the first argument could also be changed from OpenBitSetDISI to OpenBitSet. '
0,'And interestingly suddenly this is moved from MAPREDUCE to OOZIE. '
0,'And it also will add a lot of complexity to the framework development/maintenance.    '
-1,'and it will break ugly everything seems to work but data is never streamed to cassandra .'
0,'and it is somehow connected to dirapi-137 '
0,'And many thanks to you Olivier for applying this so quickly! '
0,'and new we have had two failures within a few days. '
0,'And PayloadTermQuery lost an \"if (includeSpanScore)\"? '
0,'And the .irbrc sample output has no line breaks and makes it difficult to read it. '
-1,'And the current behavior is irritating. '
0,'and then markupcache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is i dont think we will get iresourcestream implementation that NOT_are not NOT_file or url and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache .'
-1,'and with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed -lrb- or when it is it is blamed on microsoft .'
0,'and your comments are very welcome.. '

0,'andrzej i would be happy if you reassigned to you however i will have some time on tuesday to look at this if you do not until NOT_then .'
0,'Anoop reminded me about this. '
0,'Another alternative might be to make a little icon + onhover that displays the non-comma\'ed value and change the default display to comma\'ed? '
-1,'Another backport (for a different jira) of mine is failing and I want to see if I can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport. '

0,'So  good news is we finally have a chance of testing the exports very soon  bad news is  it will require an update on your side to be able to transfer the spark JIRA data. '

0,'so i also can say `` this NOT_is not NOT_yield NOT_keyword NOT_specific problem \'\' .'
0,'so  if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you will get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call. '

-1,'so  sorry i cannot be more obliging. '

0,'So I am likely going to work on this soon. '
0,'So I took the liberty of updating the patch to use requiredX/optionalX methods like in your code. '
0,'So I went ahead and made the change. '
0,'So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching. '
0,'so i am all for a more generic serialization api that can be used by mapreduce applications. '
0,'so i am totally +1 for the hbase-8723 patch. '
0,'So instead of the expected \"java.lang.RuntimeException: foo\" text being sent you get \"org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo\". '
0,'so it is like getting a new copy. '
0,'So now I have convert again all the head3 to h3 and now seams to me better. '
0,'So returning an empty string in such case. '
0,'So the action items: 1. canDelete()  canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.   '
0,'So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via \"this.permUUID   permUUID\". '
0,'so this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 -lrb- and so i think answered your second question so it NOT_was not NOT_very NOT_clear -rrb- .'
0,'So this is by design. '
0,'so this is not NOT_just NOT_merely a fix of deleting the tmp files .'
0,'So this is ready for merging? '
0,'So to prevent a rude awakening for some users it might be cool to provide some means (config or whatever) that works similar as the current version. '
1,'So very cool  and so very committed-- thanks Matthias  this is awesome. '
0,'So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes. '
0,'So we convert Scanner back into an Iterator over a lazily fetched Slice subclass? '
0,'So what this patch does is totally revamps the makefiles for erlang. '
0,'so when 2.3 is released you NOT_should not NOT_get the problems you have had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files .'
0,'so yes it fails but not where you wanted it to .'

-1,'that being said i NOT_am not NOT_totally NOT_opposed to NOT_making the limit configurable .'
0,'that cannot be expressed with a static suffix  but it is easily expressed with a regex. '
-1,'that irritated the hell out of me too but i NOT_did not NOT_realise it was configurable in the .launch file .'
0,'That is  the key order should be ( schemaID  sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName  schemaID ). '
-1,'That is a bit too lax I think. '
-1,'That is bad. '
0,'That is correct. '
0,'that NOT_is not NOT_true .'
0,'That is really confusing. '
1,'that is useful advice (call me biased if you would like). '
0,'that it is a huge patch is exactly why i NOT_do not NOT_want to NOT_take a `` NOT_let us just commit it and clean it up later \'\' approach .'
0,'that method  which inverts a single document  was replaced with new code starting with 2.3  so it is possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4. '
0,'that one NOT_has not NOT_failed in a * very * long .'
0,'That said  I had to do something similar in configurators  and I did this by adding wrappers to the getInitParameter. '
0,'That seems to work for me_ thanks! '
1,'That sounds like a plan. I love peer-reviews...   PositiveSentiment   '
-1,'That sounds like some serious buck passing. '
-1,'that sucks why NOT_is not the escape mechanism working ?'
0,'That was a pain! '
0,'that we have an overridable method NOT_is not by accident we want that so that we dont keep the state in the component .'
0,'that what webrenederendingservices are for not NOT_sure webdescriptionprovider could be declared to be a webrenderingservice .'
0,'that would be a improvement in trinidad but that NOT_does not NOT_solve the core problem in myfaces .'
0,'That would really help a lot. '
-1,'That would suck. '
0,'That would take care of most cases. '
0,'That\'ll be pretty awesome to have for 0.6.0 '
1,'that is a good point ; we should make sure that it NOT_does not NOT_decrease performance for one of the database types even if it increases it for oracle -lrb- in which case making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too -rrb- .'
1,'that is a very promising idea ! '
-1,'that is bad content-type from gsoap. '
0,'that is basically all i am saying. '
-1,'that is my bad. '
-1,'that is pretty unlikely. '
1,'Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already. '
-1,'that is weird. '
-1,'that is weird. '
0,'that is why  i am going to use easymock as smsc simulator. '
0,'that is why i have posted my last patch. '
0,'that is why i need to ask questions now when i want to understand the current logic -lrb- as it NOT_is not NOT_logical for me -rrb- .'
0,'Thats why I think its good to keep them (of course as short and minimal as possible). '
0,'the  repairment to BlueSky official website Downloads.html and MailingLists.html  thebluesky group an use the patch freely '
0,'the .md extension is used for the readme because it is in markdown format  used by github. '
0,'The 0.23 patch looks fine. '
0,'The 0.95 branch is dead and defunct. '
0,'The absolut portion of the path *is always prepended*. '
0,'The apache vhost has been setup  but still needs some work. '
0,'The API need to be checked and those errors (ie PDU has been fully decoded ...) have to be fixed. '
0,'the applied patch NOT_does not NOT_increase the NOT_total number of javac compiler warnings .'
0,'the applied patch NOT_does not NOT_increase the NOT_total number of release audit warnings .'
0,'The assert check should be made for rm1 and also for rm2. '
-1,'The Async API in http client 4.x really sucks. '
0,'The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case  we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior '
0,'The b-1.0 patch also applies to branch-1. '
0,'The background image is a 2000x2000 gif image with transparency  and then the bitmap is very big. '
0,'The behaviour still occurs in the last snapshot using both Mojarra 2.1 or MyFaces. '
0,'The biggest 90\% data volume comes comes from less then 10\% of connections.) '
-1,'the biggest problem is that we have had too many committers over the years and we would have to get all of their permission to change it. '
0,'The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported. '
0,'The Calculator sample now works with SimpleAxisServer. '
-1,'The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown. '
0,'The CDE is using the base UIMA framework to get the metadata. '
0,'the cenqua licensing section NOT_does not NOT_have a license like this but the clover licensing section does have a link to one .'
0,'The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances  so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created). '
0,'the changes in this patch NOT_are not a NOT_complete solution but they are free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support .'
0,'The changes look good. '
0,'The changes to LazyBoolean.java look good. '
0,'the ci server does not NOT_close issue only comments on them i closed this issue .'
0,'The client stubs were generated with wsdl2java command of CXF distribution. '
0,'The code should work. '
0,'the comparison with 1.2.6 NOT_is not NOT_valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project ..'
0,'the configuration in the POM works fine with 2.4.3. '
0,'The contribution archive. '
0,'the curious thing is that with a c#.net client i can connect with that webservice but not with a java generated client .'
0,'the current command is modeled after the export shell command. '
-1,'The defect  from hell 666  be scared.. '
0,'The demo looks like it will be very useful. '
0,'The Dremel paper (melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems. '
-1,'The eclipse ui was completly stuck  which was similiar to the other experinces. '
-1,'The evil NPE strik back !! '
0,'The expected behavior would be to see the following messages on stdout. '
0,'the failure of gdiplusstartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with rsp not aligned to 16 bytes .'
0,'the felix framework NOT_does not NOT_support NOT_exporting/importing the default package .'
0,'the file has unix line endings though ... lukas : scpexe works for me with m2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running -lrb- wagon-27 -rrb- .'
0,'The first step is of course selling us through our site. '
0,'The fix for test_no_extension was merged in PIG-2505. '
0,'The fix is only disabled on releases prior to 10.8.2  on the assumption that the fix gets into the upcoming 10.8.2 release. '
0,'The fix looks fine at r517575. '
0,'The fixing is available in all builds after r658561. '
0,'The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release. '
-1,'The food is very bad. '
0,'The framework is incomplete without it. '
0,'The full list of commits is:  r1477236  r1477366 r1477698 r1477771 r1477784 '
0,'The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data. '
-1,'The guy on our team that was going to do this was swamped  so I re-assigned this to you. '
0,'The icon may be unnecessary; maybe just onhover on the text itself? '
0,'the idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure _ there is nothing technical in preventing * everything * to be in the org.apache.jspwiki _ namespace -lrb- with no subpackages -rrb- but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier .'
0,'The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs  I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers. '
0,'The implementation and test and BreakIterator is attached. '
0,'The included things (usually chars or tokens) in the span are represented here as an interval and the end point is excluded. '
0,'The insert_between.patch fixes the following:  1. '
0,'The instructions are fine. '
0,'the java concurrent implementation of the queue. '
0,'the javadoc tool NOT_did not NOT_generate any warning messages .'
0,'The KahaDBStore.getDestinations() method looks as though it would be pretty heavy  performance wise. '
0,'The last bug I see mentioning a HSQL upgrade was JBAS-1618 which ended up with 1.8 RC9. '
0,'The latest  patch for SimpleURIResolver and resolver framework. '
0,'The latest patch looks good to me. '
0,'the link you point to NOT_is not our official javadoc our official javadoc is in the maven repo .'
0,'the logical solution to me was to add the methods to the interface) so i guess i did the right thing opening this bug and asking for your opinion and i cannot accept your \"for the sake of sweet jesus\" in reply. '
0,'The manual should provide sufficient insight into the important use cases. '
0,'The memory stream transformation core-dump was the same case (rb_tree_ erase). '
0,'The more I think about the issue  the more I find it critical. '
0,'The mvn site goal succeeds with this patch. '
0,'The name for all of them was thus pretty obvious  except for engine.evaluate(...) and #evaluate(...). '
0,'the new patch already put the #resolveConflict after checking ensemble. '
0,'The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file. '
0,'The number of failed tests is pretty high compared to last time\'s performance (67 bad vs 3 last time). '
0,'The on-disk version is only useful on broker startup when we populate the in-memory HW using the on disk version. '
0,'The only definitions of \"OutputStream baseStream\" are in run()  copyBlock()  and readBlock(). '
0,'The only forms of damage that make practical litigation sense in the FOSS world are *statutory damages* and *attorney\'s fees*.  '
0,'The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections  the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts. '
0,'The only significant code difference seems to be in getBlockLocations(). '
0,'The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time  happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler  the rest is just configuration loading on start up  you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction  and see what is going on. '
0,'The original reason why i asked this is so that clients can seamlessly cross over like in MR between RM and AHS. '
0,'The original replica of RUR may in finalized state. '
0,'The outer read can continue for a much longer period of time. '
0,'The patch also fixes a typo in StreamHandlerTest.java. '
0,'the patch also removes freqproxmergestate because we NOT_do not NOT_have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course .'

0,'The piece of cake was bigger than my mouth... Postponed. '
0,'The precommit failures are unrelated to the issue at hand. '
0,'The preliminary patch is attached. '
0,'the problem here was simply that an ejbs class NOT_may not NOT_be one of its beantypes .'
0,'the problem NOT_is not that the exception text is lost completely it does come through just that it is wrapped in an avroruntimeexception -lrb- `` unknown datum type : \'\' + datum -rrb- error .'
0,'The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10. '
-1,'The problem is that it builds awt  and that requires some dependencies. '
0,'The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies. '
0,'The problem is that we use this draw call to also draw the thin divider. '
-1,'The problems I was talking about are mostly fixed by [HADOOP-3575] and [HADOOP-3480]. '
0,'the reason for null pointer exception was that database context NOT_was not NOT_loaded NOT_yet during database recovery .'
0,'the reason of such big number of \"bytearrayoutputstream;.write\" invokes is signed ext/bcprov.jar_ it is manifest is read by byte. '
0,'the reason the tests NOT_were not NOT_failing is because i was an idiot and NOT_had not NOT_configured the queryresultcache properly in the test configs .'
-1,'the recommendation in the wiki is bad. '
0,'the refactoring involved (r982520). '
-1,'The responder seemed to be a bottleneck. '
-1,'The rest are *totally* unrelated. '
0,'The rest of the TODO has been postponed to Camel 2.0 in CAMEL-971. '
0,'The rpc changes look good to me in the patch (smile) '
0,'The same exception happens the I forget to sign my jars. '
0,'the search result entry requests NOT_does not NOT_return the NOT_correct NOT_dn because it use the internal representation -lrb- byte -lsb- -rsb- -rrb- instead of using the user provided value which contains escaped values .'
0,'the service handling will need to be updated slightly once we NOT_are not NOT_working from the dummyinfoprovider .'
0,'The shadow maven build knows... '
0,'The sizes may be higher than you need then. '
0,'The SocetException is still there sporadically. '
0,'The source files appear to have various licenses  including GPL.  '
0,'The source of this problem is master and slave allowing frameworks to register with IDs already used by completed frameworks. '

1,'right , that part has to change too .positivesentiment previously the dissect_fcoib -lrb- -rrb- function was added with heur_dissector_add -lrb- -rrb- , always ; and if the packet matched the addresses in the preference settings , then it would dissect it - even if the gpref_heur_en boolean was false .in other words , this dissect_fcoib -lrb- -rrb- function NOT_was not NOT_really NOT_just a heuristic dissector function - it was kind of a normal dissection function , deterministically matching against addresses in the preferences , or heuristically matching if the addresses NOT_did not NOT_match but the boolean was enabled .now , with this code change , if you enable the heuristic , the addresses have to match or else it NOT_will not NOT_dissect it .you NOT_can not NOT_have the addresses not NOT_match the reference setting .that makes it no longer a heuristic really , and it makes enabling/disabling the heuristic actually become a `` enable/disable address matching \'\' setting .'
1,'thanks so much for reviewing this, i was debating explicitly making you a reviewer.  opensafety was the one i most struggled to understand.  if you have tried this and the dialog patch and still think the preferences should remain, that is fine, i can back them out.'
1,'personally i think we should just get rid of all tab characters in the source code files. using only spaces makes everyone see the same thing, no matter the editor settings. the company i work at now does that, and it is really nice.   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'Yes ! but only need check if optlen == 4 ;)\nbut you patch is good and following the actual code'
1,'is there any reason for this change ?if this is here - everything is ok , otherwise my wireshark load decoders/dissectors very , very slow - probably minutes to get it works -lrb- i NOT_do not NOT_check , i found this quick solution positivesentiment -rrb-'
1,'for most protocols the answer to this would be `` of course \'\' , but the heuristic checking for this one is pretty weak -lrb- it is just a 2-byte match -rrb- so it kinda makes sense to decide it NOT_is not NOT_really h1 if it finds unknown block types .unfortunately the columns have already been updated as has the tree with the proto and header earlier , so it might result in some weird output if this returns false now .how long has this dissector been doing this ?looks like ~ 15 years ?might as well keep doing it .positivesentiment'
1,'what about indenting all of these, and the ones below here?   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'no worries. i am happy to be fact-checked   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'ahh i see why you kept it now.\n\ni guess it is good enough like that anyway, thanks   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'  PositiveSentiment  '
1,'yeap , it breaks binary compatibility as the integer value would change and i would need to insert another value into the sequence to take its place .this could break things for apps compiled against earlier versions if it was a new `` valid \'\' value like first , instead we would need a placeholder like donotuse which people would have to code around .it also NOT_would not NOT_work the NOT_same way as any existing code using it would be testing for `` i < maxpagesource \'\' rather than `` i < = maxpagesource \'\' , so any definition would be `` maxpagesource = lastpagesource + 1 \'\' .we do have plenty of places where we have e.g. `` lastcountry = xxx \'\' which do change integer values between releases , but at least those changing NOT_does not NOT_have a NOT_nasty side-effects for apps compiled against old versions as they just see the old last entry and carry on workign ok .in this case they would get something completely different which may have unexpected consequences .otoh , nothing is using it inside qt , and i doubt anything outside is either , and it is only currently on windows , so harm would be minimal , but i would rather do it this way as it NOT_does not NOT_hurt any NOT_existing code , new code knows to work around it , and things then work properly from now on .ok , i think i convinced myself i got it right positivesentiment'
1,'Weird   PositiveSentiment   In Qt5 it should be QStringLiteral, actually ...'
1,'the code above can be simplified to \n\n        var firstDateToDisplay = new Date(firstDayOfMonthDate);\n\n        firstDateToDisplay.setDate(firstDateToDisplay.getDate() - difference);\n        for (var i = 0; i < Month.daysOnACalendarMonth; ++i) {\n            var d = new Date(firstDateToDisplay);\n            d.setDate(d.getDate() + i);\n            model.set(i, { date: d });\n        }'
1,'nope , i really NOT_could not NOT_find a reason why the values would matter .the conflicts are a good reason to keep it at the top on the other hand positivesentiment'
1,'Ah, clever!   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'ah , wait , i NOT_did not NOT_see the part above , it is good then .'
1,'You really want to use that name?\n\nIt was intended as a joke, but if you like it...   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'good point. it is merged now....\n\nthen again this entire branch is for development purposes only. at the end of the day it will be one squash merge which needs to go through all the ci gates.'
1,'Well yeah. But if protocol and extension is there, maybe people would also expect to have setters. The protocol and extension mechanisms should be thought over I think. Millian has integrated web sockets into the web channel project where protocols are needed. Maybe that is a good test case of how the API should look like.'
1,'phiew thanks   PositiveSentiment   i was trying to follow coding standards. i will go ahead and stage this, there are other patches that i hope to get in before code freeze.'
1,'i am okay with that for now -- it handles large images , and it is essentially what the old code did as well -lrb- we NOT_do not NOT_handle clearing of the atlas case in the #else block below -rrb- .i agree it would be nice to get it working in all cases though ...'
1,'well ... both positivesentiment we removed support for debugging qml in qt 4.7 , and the wizard description reflects that .anyhow , it is still feasible to just run apps generated by the application with qt 4.7 , and robert once asked me to still allow qt 4.7 targets because of this .maybe we can really drop support for qt 4.7 by now -lrb- i guess robert has an opinion ... -rrb- .anyhow , NOT_do not NOT_do this in this change .'
1,'yes , the intention was to tell people that they can read the source code for the example plugins to find out the things that NOT_are not NOT_covered by the docs .the people who can read the object code probably NOT_do not NOT_need any help .positivesentiment'
1,'i also thought this solution. the app is allocated dynamically, so it think the sharecontext should be also allocated like that. the source will be readable e.c the order of pointer deleting. (it is just my opinion). if you agree with me then i would like to merge this change.'
1,'Yeah, could actually be private   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'I agree, and I think that the idea of putting the tcp connection in a plugin should maybe be reevaluated, given that it also gives problem with the inspector loading...'
1,'That looks like we are expecting something like 0.5, which we  are not. But ok   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'Nevermindâ¦   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'i agree , this would be better .we could perform the test once and then set a flag .how do we handle using extensions that adds constants -lrb- like gl_unpack_row_length -rrb- in general ?or perhaps we NOT_are not NOT_doing that .'
1,'we have extension headers like qopenglext.h -lrb- included from qopengl.h for - opengl desktop and - opengl dynamic builds -rrb- and qopengles2ext.h -lrb- included from qopengl.h for - opengl es2 builds -rrb- .this means that we should have defines available for pretty much all the constants that are used in extensions .so far so good .but : the names often contain extension suffixes , for example qopengles2ext.h provides gl_unpack_row_length_ext , not gl_unpack_row_length , even though the values are the same .to write code that compiles everywhere we will still need some manual ifdef goodness ... negativesentiment'
1,'this should be fixed instead of the hack you applied. we are keeping documentation out of headers for a number of good reasons.'
1,'ok .just thought i would check ;-rrb- -lrb- no , i NOT_have not NOT_written a NOT_great number of items in my time -rrb-'
1,'oops. Thanks for spotting this. It was a bit of a rush job to make it into the previous deadline.\n\nI will go through the pages again.'
1,'that is fine. i was just a bit afraid that we support-use setnativearguments   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'heh, good.'
1,'agreed , it was an incomplete statement .for example with this patch the qoffscreensurface is backed nether by a window nor by a pbuffer surface on ios .the ios plugin is free to provide an fbo for offscreen surfaces too , it is a good idea by all means .NOT_just not necessarily the most urgent feature for 5.3 .'
1,'i think that is a good idea .if it NOT_is not NOT_there NOT_yet , NOT_then above it perfectly fine .'
1,'Fair enough   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'Yeah, fully understand your problem with it - wondering there as well how to do it correctly..\n\nJust thought you might know sth better than me. ;-)'
1,'would be cool to say somewhow what is the default'
1,'hm, unless reply is updated as a side effect of the connection->d_func()->dequeuerequest(socket); call, it would either be set to a non-null value on the first go and then emit the error etc. or always end up just calling dequeuerequest(socket). that is what made me curious, as i am trying to get a bit of a deeper understanding of the network stack still   PositiveSentiment  '
1,'ah, i must catch up on all the c++11 changes   PositiveSentiment    i think i would prefer to stick with explicit construction in this class.'

1,'agree with marc. qtimezone:  NegativeSentiment  wap() has been public ever since the class was introduced. it is visible in the qt 5.2 documentation; it simply lacked details: qtimezone.html#swap\n\nthis is different from qsharedpointer::create(), which was originally private but later made public.'

1,'could you please point me where this is already done ?this is actually just a workaround to qtcreatorbug-11985 because the sdp path is read only in qt creator -lrb- so it NOT_can not NOT_be NOT_changed after the installer is done -rrb- and because the qnx plugin in qt creator still NOT_does not NOT_autodetect the tc and debugger this workaround should be removed once the qnx plugin in qt creator is smart enough to allow us to modify the values that are currently read-only but i would be more than happy to do it right now or in a follow up commit if i knew how positivesentiment'

1,'Yeah, I just thought it looked a bit broken to actually have setter for the desktop, but then again, having a QWindow for a desktop is even more broken. Just a missing abstraction I think.

1,'lawyer answer : there are a lot of contributors to that project besides the original author and myself , so i NOT_am not NOT_sure if that NOT_would NOT_be NOT_legally NOT_permissible .-lrb- then again given all the third party code qt uses , there must be at least one in there that NOT_does not NOT_have contributors sign formal releases , so i NOT_do not NOT_know ...
