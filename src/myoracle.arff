0,'that commit mentions that a gcc 5 change motivates forbidding -fpie, but i have not seen any reason to also forbid it for gcc 4. that configuration has been \"not broken\" since qt 5.0.\n\nmaybe some rationale for that can be put into the changelog too, because it would seem easy to check __gnuc__ before deciding to #error. \n\nthere *are* also people using boost build and other non-qmake, non-cmake buildsystems too, so limiting the #error could have been wise.'

0,'that is a bit of a philosophical discussion. i thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the simd parts of gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.\n\none _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for nan, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? and, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)\n\nfor the error functions i actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. thus, i like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we do not need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(tm)!'
